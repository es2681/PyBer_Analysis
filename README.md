## Results
- Urban cities have the largest number of rides, the largest number of drivers, and the lowest average fares compared to rural and suburban cities. Rural cities have the least number of rides, least number of drivers, and highest fares compared to urban and suburban cities.

## Analysis
A limited supply of drivers in rural areas increases the price per ride. Because of high fare prices, fewer people are able to afford PyBer rides in these rural areas. To make ride sharing more equitable, I reccomend that PyBer increase the number of drivers in rural communities. This will help drive the price per ride down. As such, ride demand will increase and PyBer will begin to grow in these areas.
