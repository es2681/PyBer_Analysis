# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to assist the ride-sharing app company PyBer better understand its data in urban, suburban, and rural areas. 

## Results
- Urban cities have the largest number of rides, the largest number of drivers, and the lowest average fares compared to rural and suburban cities. Rural cities have the least number of rides, least number of drivers, and highest fares compared to urban and suburban cities. See Figure 1 in the Analysis folder for additional information. 
- Urban cities had an average of 24 PyBer rides per city in 2019. Suburban cities had an average of 17 rides and rural cities had an average of 7 rides per city in 2019. See Figure 2 in the Analysis folder for additional information.
- The average fare in urban cities in 2019 was $24.53 per ride. The average fare in suburban cities was $30.97 and the average fare per ride in rural cities was $34.62 in 2019. See Figure 3 in the Analysis folder for additional information.
- In 2019, the average urban city had approximately 37 PyBer drivers. The average suburban city had approximately 14 drivers and rural cities had an average of roughly 4 drivers per city in 2019. See Figure 4 in the Analysis folder for additional information.
- In 2019, 62.7% of all PyBer fares were collected in urban cities, 30.5% of fares were collected from suburban cities, and 6.8% of fares were collected in rural cities. See Figure 5 in the Analysis folder for additional information.
- Of total ridership, 68.4% of total rides in 2019 occurred in urban cities, 26.3% occurred in suburban cities, and 5.3% occurred in rural cities. See Figure 6 in the Analysis folder for additional information.
- 80.9% of all PyBer drivers operated in urban cities in 2019. 16.5% of PyBer drivers operated in suburban cities, and 2.6% of drivers operated in rural cities in 2019. See Figure 7 in the Analysis folder for additional information.
- There is no discerable pattern in the fluctuation of fares in urban, suburban, and rural cities collected between January 1, 2019 and April 27, 2019. See the PyBer Fare Summary figure in the Analysis folder for additional information. 

## Analysis
A limited supply of drivers in rural areas increases the price per ride. Because of high fare prices, fewer people are able to afford PyBer rides in these rural areas. To make ride sharing more equitable, I reccomend that PyBer increase the number of drivers in rural communities. This will help drive the price per ride down. As such, ride demand will increase and PyBer will begin to grow in these areas.
